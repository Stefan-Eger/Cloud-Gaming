So in order to start the game first start the VVE part found in "Chess_Game_VVE.zip" and then
start the client found in "Client.rar".

The Input Possibilities:
Left Click -> on Figures selects them if possible
Right Click -> on highlighted field after selected Figures will move to clicked on Field

R, K, B, Q -> if a Pawn reached the end of the board then these letters will determine the 
figure to which the pawn will be promoted.

Notes:
There is a slight delay while interacting with the Client Window until stream reaches it again.
Every Action on the VVE side can be performed on the client side.
